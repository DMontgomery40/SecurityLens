## What is SecurityLens?
[//]: # (Hint 2: URLs aren't just for websites...)

SecurityLens is an educational tool designed to **bridge the gap** between curious minds and real-world security concepts. No need for advanced command-line skills or pricey security suites. If you can paste a link or drag a file, you’re good to go!

### Why This Matters
- **Security should be accessible**: Tools like Kali Linux or Burp Suite can feel daunting to a newcomer.
- **Hands-on learning**: We believe you learn better by *trying* things, not just reading about them.
- **Next-gen security pros**: We need more people (of all ages!) excited about protecting digital spaces.

## How It Works

1. **Scan a GitHub Repo**: Paste in the URL of an open-source project or your personal repo.
2. **Check a Live Website**: Curious if a site has potential issues? Enter the address—no special setup needed.
3. **Analyze Local Code**: Drag and drop files from your machine to see what might be lurking in your own projects.
4. **Firmware/Binary (Coming Soon!)**: We’re working on a mini-lab approach to help you peek inside binaries without advanced tools.

## Understanding Your Discoveries

When you run a scan, you’ll see potential issues sorted by **severity**:

- **CRITICAL**:  
  Whoa! Immediate attention needed—like leaving your front door wide open!  
- **HIGH**:  
  Serious stuff—like a weak lock that a determined intruder could easily crack.  
- **MEDIUM**:  
  Worth fixing—think of it as upgrading old locks to sturdier ones.  
- **LOW**:  
  Good practice—like adding a camera to an already secure house. Always nice to have.

Each finding includes a quick explanation of **why** it matters, some **code examples**, multipe **references** to learn more,and **tips** to fix it—so you can learn and apply that knowledge going forward.

## Pro Tips for Young Security Researchers

- **Look deeper**: Don’t just stop at the first warning. Real security experts always ask *“Why?”*  
- **Examine the code**: Our examples show you *exactly* where vulnerabilities might lurk.  
- **Explore solutions**: We provide “safe” snippets or pointers to help you patch issues effectively.  
- **No gatekeeping**: If you don’t know a term, no worries! That’s why we’re here—to make it clear and approachable.
